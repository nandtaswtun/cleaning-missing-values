what is an EDA?

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is a critical initial phase in the data analysis process. Its primary objective is to investigate and summarize the main characteristics of a dataset, often employing both statistical methods and data visualization techniques.

EDA serves several key purposes:

* To gain an understanding of the datasetâ€™s structure, distribution, and underlying patterns
* To identify potential anomalies, outliers, or data quality issues (such as missing or inconsistent values)
* To evaluate relationships between variables and test initial hypotheses
* To inform the selection of appropriate statistical models or machine learning algorithms

Common EDA techniques include the use of descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation), graphical representations (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps), and data aggregation methods (e.g., grouping and pivot tables).

Overall, EDA provides essential insights that guide subsequent phases of data modeling and interpretation.
